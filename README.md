# Cholesterol-Data-Analysis
The data utilized in this project were made available by the inter-university Consortium
for Political and Social Research. The data for National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANS) II, 1976-1980: Serum Cholesterol was originally collected by United States
Department of Health and Human Services.
In addition to the general examination components, several more detailed examinations
were performed on subsamples of the population. The information relating to serum choles-
terol in NHANS II survey considers codes 355-357. Primary site codes are 1 and 2 for males
and females respectively. Similarly, codes for white, black, and other are 1, 2, and 3 respec-
tively. Sample data has been randomly selected from original data.
